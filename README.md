# CARD ANIMATION

## Introduction

I built a Quick card 

Created a card which has both it's front and its back section loaded with different texts. Naturally you see the front text and On hover you see the back text and a beautiful transition that accompany's it.


## Conclusion

This is a fun Code Day

The files include both *HTML* and *CSS* only. The cards are created in a coin manner where each card has two sides each with different texts appended to each side and a good transition value added to make better usability and experience.
